        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Tyler Shoemaker is a Neukom Fellow at the <a
        href="https://neukom.dartmouth.edu" target="_blank">Neukom Institute
        for Computational Science</a>. A digital humanist, he conducts research
        on language technology, focusing on how methods in natural language
        processing (NLP) crosscut the interpretive and theoretic frameworks of
        literary and media studies. Prior to joining the Neukom Institute,
        Tyler was a Postdoctoral Scholar affiliated with the <a
        href="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">UC Davis
        DataLab</a>. There, he developed NLP methods across a variety of
        research domains, ranging from early modern print to environmental and
        health sciences.</p>
